>### module2 description
>module2.js is logical comparator. It takes signal inputs in Inputs 1 & 2, and outputs the Max, Min, Mix of the two signals out Outputs 1, 2, 3, respectively.

>- Inputs: IN1, IN2
>- Outputs: OUT1, OUT2, OUT3

>## Score:

>Build a rhythmic pattern using the highlighted controls - culminating in noise morphing into tone.

A low winding sound pulsates in the left. 3 or so pulses of that winding sound begin prior to a slowly alternating low reverberation pulsates on the right.  As they slowly rise in amplitude, period after period, 19 seconds in, appears a sort of chime on the right, blending in with the reverb.  That chime gets louder, but its pitch changes back to a lower reverb, but still with higher amplitude.

>Lfo-1 freq results in speed changes.<br/>
For at least the first minute (~60s) you don't really notice any speed changes.  This doesn't seem to happen until about ~82s into the recording.

>The left random rate results in “aftershocks” of rhythmic content.<br/>
The aftershocks heard are slightly unpleasant, but yet keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting to hear if they sharpen out their surrounding noise,  A noise, mind you, that sounds like you should be constantly on alert to lower your volume in case in clips out of control and pops your speakers!

At ~49 seconds in, the aftershock started to sound more like a smashing sound. My partner sitting beside me, reading, hears this and shouts: "Atari Pole Position!"

~82 seconds in, and the speed begins increase.  ~10s after that, and the volume increases, making the messy aftershock sound even more messy with surrounding noise.

>VCF freq results in higher overtone-like content
