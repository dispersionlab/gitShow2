>### module2 description
>module2.js is logical comparator. It takes signal inputs in Inputs 1 & 2, and outputs the Max, Min, Mix of the two signals out Outputs 1, 2, 3, respectively.

>- Inputs: IN1, IN2
>- Outputs: OUT1, OUT2, OUT3

>## Score:

>Build a rhythmic pattern using the highlighted controls - culminating in noise morphing into tone.

A low winding sound pulsates in the left. 3 or so pulses of that winding sound begin prior to a slowly alternating low reverberation pulsates on the right.  As they slowly rise in amplitude, period after period, 19 seconds in, appears a sort of chime on the right, blending in with the reverb.  That chime gets louder, but its pitch changes back to a lower reverb, but still with higher amplitude.

>Lfo-1 freq results in speed changes.<br/>
>The left random rate results in “aftershocks” of rhythmic content.<br/>
>VCF freq results in higher overtone-like content
